== Podio sample Rails application

This app demonstrates how to authenticate against Podio, and how to read and write items.

== Preparations on Podio

Create an API key by logging into Podio and go to Account Settings in the My Account dropdown. Then go to the API Keys tab and write a name and a domain for this app. While you are developing, you probably want to set the domain to localhost:3000 or similar.

To be able to run this sample you must also have the Leads app installed on Podio. It can be installed from the App Store: https://podio.com/store/app/1258-leads. You can also use another app, but then this example won't work "out of the box".

== Configuration

You must put your API key and secret in the environment variables PODIO_CLIENT_ID and PODIO_CLIENT_SECRET. Alternatively you can hardcode them in config/initializers/podio.rb.

You must also update the hardcoded APP_ID constant in app/models/lead.rb to the app id of your instance of the Leads app. You find this id by going to the Leads app on Podio and copying the last numerical part of the url.

== Tips

You probably want to work with Podio apps that has a completely different structure than the Leads app used in this example. The easiest way to the see the structure and the all-important external ids of you app, is to go to https://developers.podio.com/doc/applications/get-app-22349 and enter the app id with "full" as type in the in the sandbox.

You can also see exactly what fields and values you get from a Get Items call by using the sandbox here: https://developers.podio.com/doc/items/get-items-27803
